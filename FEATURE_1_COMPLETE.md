## 🔄 User Flow

4. **Skip Option** → Can complete later via "Complete Profile" button

## 💾 Backend Integration

### **Existing Routes (Already Working):**
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Updates user profile, goals, preferences
- Profile data structure:
```javascript
{
  profile: { age, gender, height, weight, fitnessLevel, activityLevel },
  goals: { fitnessGoal, targetWeight, weeklyWorkouts },
  preferences: { equipment[], workoutDuration, injuries[] }
}
```

### **AI Context Enhancement:**
The Gemini AI service (`backend/services/gemini.js`) already receives and uses:
- Fitness Level
- Fitness Goal
- Equipment Available
- Workout Duration
- Injuries/Limitations
- Weekly Workout Frequency

This provides **highly personalized recommendations** based on user profile!
